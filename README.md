An interesting programming problem.

Not intended to be fully functional. Some bits have been left-out for out mutual amusement.

Remove the bits you don't have or create those you need. Supply your own data and you too can use this code.

Hey, if you wanna be a software engineer you gotta deal with whatever bits you don't got, right ?!?  Get over it !!!

Enjoy !!!
